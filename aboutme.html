					<h2>My name is </br> Konstantin Ovcharov</h2>

				</header>

				
				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>I earned my bachelor's degree from Zealand Erhvervsakademi where I graduated with AP in Computer
					Science and Top-Up in Web Development.</br>In my <b>Computer Science</b> courses I was introduced to
					programming by working with C#, I had the opportunity to learn about Agile Methodologies,
					particularly Scrum, and I also learned about web development with Typescript and Angular.
					</br>In my <b>Web Development</b> courses I was introduced to Content Management Systems like
					WordPress and Umbraco and had more opportunities to develop with Angular by working with Royal Brew
					to create a system to manage incoming and outgoing truck drivers as well as making it easier for
					those drivers to navigate around the brewery to make them perform their job easier. I also had
					elective courses that focused on relational databases with SQL and web development with JavaScript
					and React. </br>
					</br>
					I decided to stop my master's degree in <b>Computer Science and Informatics at Roskilde University
					</b> after the third semester because I wanted to focus more on becoming a front-end developer.
					While at <b> Roskilde University </b> I had the opportunities to learn to develop full stack
					applications with PostgreSQL, ASP.NET and JavaScript, take courses about software system
					architecture and have electives about Business Intelligence, Big Data Analysis, Project Management,
					AI and Deep Learning. </p>
					Currently I am taking the Odin's project Web Development course.</br>
				</br>
				<h3>Working Experience</h3>
				<p>During my education at Zealand Erhvervsakademi I did two 3 month internships. I worked for GO!
					Running Tours and BotXO.
				<p>At <b>GO! Running Tours</b> I helped redesign the layout of their website using WordPress themes and
					plugins, mainly Elementor, improving loading times, cutting down image size. I learned how to do web
					scraping for data that was going to be needed for a future feature of the website. Other things
					involved creating e-mail signatures with Microsoft Word and business cards with Adobe Illustrator.
				</p>
				<p>At <b>BotXO</b> I also had the task and opportunity to update the design of the layout of the website
					with WordPress and the Elementor plugin. I learned how to work with Microsoft Power Automate to
					handle leads from form submissions by sending the data from those leads through multiple platforms
					such as spreadsheets, mailing services and CRMs. That involved a lot of reading about API
					documentation of those platforms in order to understand how to handle the leads in the needed way.
